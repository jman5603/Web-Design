One way to prevent this from happening is to build covered bridges. Simply build one ramp up over the water, and build walls and a roof over your bridge as you cross the treacherous waters. If you have time, you can add a tower on top of your bridge to provide covering fire for your teammates as they cross the newly constructed bridge. Don't forget to destroy the bridge after you have finished using it, for enemies could find it and use it to cross the water to eliminate you and your squad mates.";

This is why hiding is such a vital part of winning matches of Fortnite. One way that many pro players hide is by sitting inside of a bush. The legendary bush item is the best option, but you can find a natural bush in the map that can work just as well. It works the best if you hold a consumable item, such as a bandage or a mini shield, and look down towards the ground. This way, your character's head will be very hard to spot. Once the storm requires you to move, just stay along the edge and move to a new bush inside of the circle.";

The quickest way to do this is to build a spiral staircase. Edit your stair into a corner stair, and build a staircase up the hill. This is the most efficient way to quickly move up a hill to escape the storm. For added protection, you can build walls around the staircase to protect from enemy fire. Once at the top of the hill, destroy the staircase so enemies can't follow you.";
